        <h1>About Healthy Snacks</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to Healthy Snacks—where snacking meets well-being. We’re passionate about making healthy eating easy, enjoyable, and accessible for everyone. Our journey started with a simple idea: finding snacks that are not only good for you but also taste amazing shouldn’t be a challenge.<br><br>

<b>Our Mission</b><br>

We believe that healthy snacking is an essential part of a balanced lifestyle. Whether you’re working, working out, or just relaxing, the snacks you choose can make a big difference in how you feel. That’s why we’ve curated a selection of snacks that are as nutritious as they are delicious. We’re here to help you make better choices without sacrificing flavor or convenience.<br><br>

<b>Our Story</b><br>

Healthy Snacks was born out of our own struggles to find snacks that ticked all the boxes—healthy, tasty, and convenient. We knew there had to be a better way, so we set out to create a place where people could easily find snacks they could feel good about eating. After lots of tasting, researching, and listening to what people really want in a snack, we launched Healthy Snacks to share our finds with you.<br><br>

<b>What We Offer</b><br>

We’ve done the hard work of sourcing snacks that meet our high standards. On our website, you’ll find a wide variety of options—from high-protein snacks to gluten-free goodies and everything in between. Each product is carefully selected to ensure it’s packed with nutrition and free from the stuff you don’t want, like artificial additives and excessive sugars. We’re all about transparency, so you’ll always know exactly what’s in your snack.<br><br>
